This project was created with ReactJS for front-end, Node.js/Express.js for backend and Postgresql for database.

This is a web app where you can use a URL ending with .jpg/.png image and it will detect the face.

Note: The image has to be under 20MB because the API that I am using has some underlying issues. Also, please use an URL that ends with .png/.jpg. Chrome has an extra layer of security now, so, it might say the password is breached, so, please make sure you use fake credentials.


You can use the following links as an example to test the face-recognition app.
