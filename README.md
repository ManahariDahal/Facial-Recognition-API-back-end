This project was created with ReactJS for front-end, Node.js/Express.js for backend and Postgresql for database.

This is a web app where you can use a URL ending with .jpg/.png image and it will detect the face.

Note: The image has to be under 20MB because the API that I am using has some underlying issues. Also, Chrome has an extra layer of security now, so, it might say the password is breached, so, please make sure you use fake credentials.
